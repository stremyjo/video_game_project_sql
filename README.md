## Introduction

This dataset contains a list of video games dating from 1980 to 2023, providing information such as release dates, user review ratings, critic review ratings, and more. The original dataset contains errors, duplicates, null values, inconsistencies, invalid data types, and other issues that need to be cleaned up before the data can be used for analysis and deriving insights.

## Business Problem

One of my friends faced the challenge of deciding which video games to purchase for himself and his friends. To assist in this decision-making process, I found a dataset from Kaggle that includes the top 100 video games on "backloggd" from 1980 to 2023. The goal was to clean and format this dataset, creating a comprehensive gaming database that can be shared with others facing a similar problem. However, before the dataset can be used for analysis, it requires cleaning, proper formatting of columns, and validation of data.

## Aim

The aim of cleaning this dataset is to ensure the data is in the proper format, consistent, well-organized, and clean enough to be useful for my client (my friend) and any third party that needs to utilize the data. The objectives of the cleaning process are as follows:

- Eliminate errors.
- Remove redundancy and unnecessary data.
- Increase data reliability.
- Ensure accuracy.
- Maintain consistency.
