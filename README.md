## Introduction

This dataset contains a list of video games dating from 1980 to 2023, providing data such as release dates, user review rating, critic review rating, and more. The original dataset includes errors, duplicates, null values, inconsistencies, invalid data types, and other issues that need to be addressed before it can be used for analysis and drawing key insights.

## Business Problem

One of my friends was tasked with the difficult decision of trying to decide which video games to purchase for himself and his friends. I found this data set from Kaggle to help analyze and explore the top 100 video games on "backloggd" from 1980-2023 in order to create a detailed definitive gaming database that I could share with others with a similar problem. The dataset cannot be used for analysis as it is, so I had to clean it up, properly format the columns, and make sure the data is valid, in order for it to be used to complete the request.

## Aim

The aim of cleaning this dataset is to ensure that the data is in the correct format, consistent, well-organized, and clean enough to be valuable to my client (my friend) and any other third party seeking to use the data. Our objectives are as follows:

- Eliminate errors.
- Remove redundant and unnecessary data.
- Enhance data reliability.
- Ensure accuracy.
- Maintain consistency.
